### Week 2 Learning Objectives 

* Apply optimization methods such as (Stochastic) Gradient Descent, Momentum, RMSProp and Adam
* Use random minibatches to accelerate convergence and improve optimization
* Describe the benefits of learning rate decay and apply it to your optimization

### One Assignement:
* Optimization Methods:
  *  In this notebook, practice some more advanced optimization methods that can speed up learning and perhaps even get you to a better final value for the cost function. Having a good optimization algorithm can be the difference between waiting days vs. just a few hours to get a good result.
