### Week 1: Introduction to Deep Learning

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Discover and experiment with a variety of different initialization methods, apply L2 regularization and dropout to avoid model overfitting, then apply gradient checking to identify errors in a fraud detection model.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Give examples of how different types of initializations can lead to different results
  * Examine the importance of initialization in complex neural networks
  * Explain the difference between train/dev/test sets
  * Diagnose the bias and variance issues in your model
  * Assess the right time and place for using regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization
  * Explain Vanishing and Exploding gradients and how to deal with them
  * Use gradient checking to verify the accuracy of your backpropagation implementation
  * Apply zeros initialization, random initialization, and He initialization
  * Apply regularization to a deep learning model

* **Programming Assignements**:
  * [1] [Initialization](https://github.com/yifang-psu/Coursera_AI_ML_Courses/blob/main/Deep_Learning/ImprovingDeepNeuralNetworks/Week_1/Initialization.ipynb):
    * Training your neural network requires specifying an initial value of the weights. A well-chosen initialization method helps the learning process. In this notebook assignment, try out a few different initializations and see how they lead to different results.
  * [2] [Regularization](https://github.com/yifang-psu/Coursera_AI_ML_Courses/blob/main/Deep_Learning/ImprovingDeepNeuralNetworks/Week_1/Regularization.ipynb):
    * In this assignment, practice to apply L2 regularization and dropout to a deep learning model that recommends positions to football players.
  * [3] [Gradient Checking](https://github.com/yifang-psu/Coursera_AI_ML_Courses/blob/main/Deep_Learning/ImprovingDeepNeuralNetworks/Week_1/Gradient_Checking.ipynb):
    * In this assignment, practice to implement gradient checking to check for errors in your implementation of a fraud detection model.
