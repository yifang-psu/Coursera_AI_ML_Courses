### Course 2: [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Opimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network)
* You will open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good results systematically. 

* By the end, you will learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications; be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking; implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence; and implement a neural network in TensorFlow.
