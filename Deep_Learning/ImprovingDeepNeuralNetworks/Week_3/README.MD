### Week 3 Learning Objectives 

* Master the process of hyperparameter tuning
* Describe softmax classification for multiple classes
* Apply batch normalization to make your neural network more robust
* Build a neural network in TensorFlow and train it on a TensorFlow dataset
* Describe the purpose and operation of GradientTape
* Use tf.Variable to modify the state of a variable
* Apply TensorFlow decorators to speed up code
* Explain the difference between a variable and a constant

### One Assignement:
* TensorFlow Introduction:
  *  In this notebook, explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more easily, and use it to build a neural network and train it on a TensorFlow dataset. .
