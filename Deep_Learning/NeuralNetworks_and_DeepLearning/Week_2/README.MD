### Week 2: Neural Networks Basics

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
  * Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implemetation (gradient descent)
  * Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
  * Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
  * Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations
  * Work with iPython Notebooks
  * Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
  * Explain the concept of broadcasting
