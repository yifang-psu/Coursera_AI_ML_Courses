### Week 2: Neural Networks Basics

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset and use vectorization to speed up your models.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Build a logistic regression model structured as a shallow neural network
  * Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including parameter initialization, cost function and gradient calculation, and optimization implemetation (gradient descent)
  * Implement computationally efficient and highly vectorized versions of models
  * Compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset
  * Use Numpy functions and Numpy matrix/vector operations
  * Work with iPython Notebooks
  * Implement vectorization across multiple training examples
  * Explain the concept of broadcasting

* **Programming Assignements**:
  * [Python Basic with Numpy](https://github.com/yifang-psu/Coursera_AI_ML_Courses/blob/main/Deep_Learning/NeuralNetworks_and_DeepLearning/Week_2/Python_Basics_with_Numpy.ipynb):
    * A brief introduction of Python.
  * [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/yifang-psu/Coursera_AI_ML_Courses/blob/main/Deep_Learning/NeuralNetworks_and_DeepLearning/Week_2/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb):
    * In this assignment, build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats (meow!). This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and so will also hone your intuitions about deep learning. By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to classify your own photo as cat/not cat (meow?).
