### Course 1: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)
  * You will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 
  * By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
