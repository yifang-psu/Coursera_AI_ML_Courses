### Week 4: Deep Networks Basics

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Analyze the key computations underlying deep learning, then use them to build and train deep neural networks for computer vision tasks.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Describe the successive block structure of a deep neural network
  * Build a deep L-layer neural network
  * Analyze matrix and vector dimensions to check neural network implementations
  * Use a cache to pass information from forward to back propagation
  * Explain the role of hyperparameters in deep learning
  * Build a 2-layer neural network
