### Week 2: Model Resource Management Techniques

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Learn how to optimize and manage the compute, storage, and I/O resources your model needs in production environments during its entire lifecycle.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Identify how data dimensionality affects model performance
  * Illustrate the curse of dimensionality and how it relates to model performance
  * Use manual dimensionality reduction to mitigate performance bottlenecks
  * Determine the applicability of algorithmic dimensionality reduction techniques to improve model performance and reduce overall computational costs
  * Use Principal Component Analysis to identify and remove redundant dimensions in high-dimensional data sets
  * Integrate model resource management techniques to optimize resources and performance
  * Differentiate the uses of quantization and pruning to optimize model resources and requirements without affecting efficiency and accuracy
