### Week 5: Interpretability

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Learn about model interpretability - the key to explaining your modelâ€™s inner workings to laypeople and expert audiences and how it promotes fairness and helps address regulatory and legal requirements for different use cases.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Deconstruct a model to understand and explain how it is making predictions
  * Determine tools to make your models explainable to yourself and others in easy to understand terms
  * Provide mechanisms to address model fairness and compliance with regulatory requirements
  * Differentiate and compare different methods to extract interpretation of models by introspection or explanation
  * Distinguish between multiple available techniques such as: Partial Dependance Plots, SHAP and LIME; to provide insight into how model predictions are actually made
  * Use cloud managed service for AI explanations
