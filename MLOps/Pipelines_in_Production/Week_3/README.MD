### Week 3: High-Performance Modeling

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Implement distributed processing and parallelism techniques to make the most of your computational resources for training your models efficiently.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Identify the rise in computational requirements with current network architectures
  * Select techniques to optimize the usage of computational resources to best serve your model needs
  * Carry out high-performance data ingestion to reduce hardware accelerators idling time
  * Distinguish between data and model parallelism to train your models in the most efficient way
  * Implement knowledge distillation to reduce models that capture complex relationships among features so that they fit in constrained deployment environments
