### Week 1: Neural Architecture Search

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Learn how to effectively search for the best model that will scale for various serving needs while constraining model complexity and hardware requirements.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Recognize the cases where Neural Architecture Search is the appropriate tool to find the right model architecture.
  * Distinguish between trainable parameters and hyperparameters
  * Judge when manual parameter search does not scale well
  * Identify search spaces and summarize the best strategies to navigate this space to find optimal architectures.
  * Differentiate the advantages and disadvantages AutoML for different use cases
  * Carry out different metric calculations to assess AutoML efficacy
  * Identify some cloud AutoML offerings and recognize their strengths and weaknesses
