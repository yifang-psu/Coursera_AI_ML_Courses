### Lab 1: Intro to Keras Tuner
* In this lab, you will get some hands-on practice with Keras Tuner. This package allows you to automatically tune your model's hyperparameters so you can optimize your model training. It alleviates the difficulty of figuring out the hyperparameters by hand which, as mentioned in the lectures, is not scalable. You will just build a simple model here but feel free to try it out in your own projects and see if you get better results.

### Lab 2: Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Training with TFX
* In this lab, you will revisit machine learning pipelines using TFX (from Course 2 of this specialization) and add two more components: Tuner and Trainer. These will basically do the same things you did in the previous ungraded lab but you will need to be mindful of the data formats and accessing component artifacts. At the end of this exercise, you should be able to build a machine learning pipeline that includes hyperparameter tuning and model training.
