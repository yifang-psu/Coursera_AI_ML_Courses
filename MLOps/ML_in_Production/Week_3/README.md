### Week 3: Data Definition and Baseline

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * This week is all about working with different data types and ensuring label consistency for classification problems. This leads to establishing a performance baseline for your model and discussing strategies to improve it given your time and resources constraints.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * List the questions you need to answer in the process of data definition.
  * Compare and contrast the types of data problems you need to solve for structured vs. unstructured and big vs. small data.
  * Explain why label consistency is important and how you can improve it
  * Explain why beating human level performance is not always indicative of success of an ML model.
  * Make a case for improving human level performance rather than beating it.
  * Identify how much training data you should gather given time and resource constraints.
  * Describe the key steps in a data pipeline.
  * Compare and contrast the proof of concept vs. production phases on an ML project.
  * Explain the importance of keeping track of data provenance and lineage.

* **Programming Assignment:**  
  * [C1W3_Data_Labeling_Ungraded_Lab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/https-deeplearning-ai/MLEP-public/blob/main/course1/week2-ungraded-lab/C1W2_Ungraded_Lab_Birds_Cats_Dogs.ipynb)
    * In this lab, you will see how the data labeling process affects the performance of a classification model. Labeling data is usually a very labor intensive and costly task but it is of great importance.
