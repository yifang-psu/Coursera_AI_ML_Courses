### Week 1: Collecting, Labeling, and Validating Data

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * This week covers a quick introduction to machine learning production systems. More concretely you will learn about leveraging the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) library to collect, label and validate data to make it production ready.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Describe the differences between ML modeling and a production ML system
  * Identify responsible data collection for building a fair production ML system
  * Discuss data and concept change and how to address it by annotating new training data with direct labeling and/or human labeling
  * Address training data issues by generating dataset statistics and creating, comparing and updating data schemas

* **Reading List:**

* **Lab Exercise:**
  * TFDV Lab

* **Programming Assignments:**
  * Data Validation
