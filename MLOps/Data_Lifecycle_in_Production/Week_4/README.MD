### Week 4: Advanced Labeling, Augmentation, and Data Preprocessing

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Combine labeled and unlabeled data to improve ML model accuracy and augment data to diversify your training set.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Discuss direct, semi-supervised, weak supervision and active learning methods for labeling data
  * Increase the diversity of your training set by data augmentation
  * Perform advanced data preparation and transformation on different structured and unstructured data types
