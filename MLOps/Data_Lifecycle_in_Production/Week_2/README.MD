### Week 2: Feature Engineering, Transformation and Selection

* **What is this week's course about?**
  * Implement feature engineering, transformation, and selection with TensorFlow Extended by encoding structured and unstructured data types and addressing class imbalances.

* **Learning Objectives:**
  * Define a set of feature engineering techniques, such as scaling and binning
  * Use TensorFlow Transform for a simple preprocessing and data transformation task
  * Describe feature space coverage and implement different feature selection methods
  * Perform feature selection using scikit-learn routines and ensure feature space coverage
